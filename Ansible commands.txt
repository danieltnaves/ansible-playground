## Execute a playbook 
ansible-playbook provisioning.yml -u vagrant -i hosts --private-key .vagrant/machines/wordpress/virtualbox/private_key

## Execute a playbook without passing private key (you need to set up hosts with user and private key)
ansible-playbook provisioning.yml -i hosts
ex:
[wordpress]
172.17.177.40 ansible_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_private_key_file="<path to private key>"
